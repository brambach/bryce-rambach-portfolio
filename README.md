## Design

Refined editorial aesthetic — mostly monochrome with serif/monospace typography contrast. Instrument Serif for display headings, JetBrains Mono for technical details, Inter for body text. Scroll-driven animations throughout including a horizontal-scroll portfolio gallery, drawing timeline, and staggered text reveals. Fully responsive with reduced-motion support.
