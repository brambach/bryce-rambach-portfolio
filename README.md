## About

I'm Bryce Rambach — a Computer Science student at San Diego State University (graduating May 2026) and Integration Specialist at Digital Directions. I build enterprise HRIS integrations connecting platforms like HiBob, NetSuite, Deputy, and Workato, and I'm targeting Solutions Engineer roles in NYC.

This site is a single-page portfolio showcasing my background, skills, and experience.

## Design

The site uses a glassmorphism aesthetic — frosted-glass cards with `backdrop-blur`, translucent gradients, and soft inset shadows over animated ambient blobs. Fully responsive with smooth scroll-triggered animations throughout.
